	<p class="movieDetail">There are plenty of ways to kick back, for just about any reason and in any season. For some of us, that can be grabbing a fresh cup of iced coffee, hitting an exercise class, spending time with friends, or going on vacation. But one of the simplest ways to take your mind off of the qualms or daily life and boost your mood, in general, is a chill night in with a classic, feel-good movie.

No matter what your preference, whether it's a classic rom-com, an animated throwback, or a flick where you're rooting for the underdog (looking at you, Andy Sachs) â€” the laughs, happy tears, and all-around mood-lifting await. Skip the endless scrolling, we did the hard work and compiled a list of the best movies to turn that frown upside down and make that smile last a while. So sit back, relax, grab your popcorn or favorite bag of hot chips, and let these feel-good movies guide your surrender to the silver screen.</p>
